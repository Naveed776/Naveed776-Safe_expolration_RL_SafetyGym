**Rollout Metrics**:

The training ran at 264 fps for 34 iterations, totaling 384 seconds and achieving 102,000 timesteps.

**Training Metrics**:

Key metrics included a KL divergence of 0.0066, a clip fraction of 0.0718, a clip range of 0.2, and an entropy loss of -2.73. The explained variance was 0.39, with a learning rate of 0.0001. There were 330 updates, a policy gradient loss of -0.00952, a standard deviation of 0.944, and a value loss of 0.0386.

**Episode Performance**:

Episode returns and costs varied widely. The highest return was 14.401 with a cost of 30.000, while the lowest return was 0.169 with no cost. The performance fluctuated significantly, indicating areas for optimization.

**Conclusion**:

The training session showed steady performance and significant progress. The key training metrics indicated a reasonably good fit with minimal policy gradient and value losses. Episode performance showed variability in returns and costs, highlighting areas for optimization. Overall, the training yielded promising results with potential for further improvement.
