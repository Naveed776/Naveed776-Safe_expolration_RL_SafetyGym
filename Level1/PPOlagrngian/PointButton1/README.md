**Rollout Metrics:**
The training session ran at a frame rate of 282 fps over 34 iterations, taking 361 seconds and achieving a total of 102,000 timesteps.

**Training Metrics:**
Key training metrics included an approximate KL divergence of 0.0075, a clip fraction of 0.0807, and a clip range of 0.2. The entropy loss was -2.71, and the explained variance stood at 0.669. The learning rate was set at 0.0001, with a loss of 0.00721 over 330 updates. The policy gradient loss was -0.00825, the standard deviation was 0.935, and the value loss was 0.0546.

**Episode Performance:**
The episodes had varied returns and costs. The highest return was 19.500 in Episode 13, while the highest cost was 264.000 in Episode 4. The lowest return was 1.859 in Episode 15, and the lowest cost was 2.000 in Episode 1. Overall, returns ranged from 1.859 to 19.500, and costs ranged from 2.000 to 264.000, indicating a wide variation in performance and resource expenditure across episodes

**Summary:**
The training session demonstrated efficient performance, completing 102,000 timesteps in 361 seconds at 282 fps over 34 iterations. Training metrics showed good optimization with minimal policy gradient and value losses. Episode performance varied, with returns ranging from 1.859 to 19.500 and costs from 2.000 to 264.000, indicating areas for potential improvement in consistency and cost management. Overall, the training was successful, with promising results for further refinement.
