The training session operated at a swift pace of 473 frames per second (fps) across 34 iterations, culminating in 102,000 total timesteps completed in 215 seconds.

**Training Metrics:**
Key training metrics included an approximate KL divergence of 0.0044, a clip fraction of 0.0458, and an entropy loss of -2.77. The model exhibited strong learning dynamics with an explained variance of 0.771, while updates refined policy gradients and minimized value loss, achieving significant optimization potential.

**Episode Performance:**
Across various episodes, returns fluctuated significantly, ranging from 4.866 to 17.012, alongside costs spanning 0.000 to 242.000. Noteworthy performances include episodes with returns such as 17.012 and costs as low as 0.000, highlighting diverse outcomes and potential areas for further performance enhancement.

**Conclusion**

The training session demonstrated high performance, achieving 102,000 timesteps in 215 seconds at 473 fps over 34 iterations. The key training metrics indicated a good fit with minimal policy gradient and value losses. Episode performance showed variability in returns and costs, with notable high returns in several episodes. Overall, the training yielded promising results with potential for further optimization in managing costs and consistency in returns.
